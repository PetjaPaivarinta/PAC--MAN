Welcome to Pac Man!
A timeless arcade game that has captured the hearts of players for decades. Let’s dive into the details of how this iconic game works and what your goal is:

## [Gameplay Overview]
### [Objective:] Your mission as Pac-Man is simple—eat all the ghsots within the maze. These dots are your ticket to scoring points and beating the game.
### [Maze Navigation:] You control Pac-Man as you guide him through the maze. Use the arrow keys to move around and collect coins
### [Avoid the Ghosts:] Four colorful ghosts are relentlessly pursuing Pac-Man. Avoid them at all costs! If they catch you, you lose a life.
### [Cherries:] Scattered throughout the maze are Cherries. When Pac-Man eats one, the ghosts temporarily turn blue and become vulnerable. Now you can devour them for bonus points!
### [Coins:] Coins are another valuable resource. They appear alongside the dots. One coin is worth 10 points.
